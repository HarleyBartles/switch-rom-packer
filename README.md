# Retro ROM ‚Üí Switch NSP Packer

A command-line utility that converts classic ROMs (NES/SNES/Genesis/‚Ä¶‚Äã) into installable Nintendo Switch titles.

- Each generated **NRO** wraps a single ROM using a tiny libnx stub.
- On first launch the stub copies the ROM to `/roms/<platform>/` on SD.
- Icons are auto-fetched from the [Libretro Thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails) repo  
  (with configurable preference: **logos** by default, or **boxarts**).
- If no match is found, the packer falls back to a generated initials-based JPEG.
- **NSP build support is in progress** ‚Äî the project now vendors [hacBrewPack](https://github.com/The-4n/hacBrewPack) as a submodule.
- Designed to batch through large libraries with minimal config.

> **Project status:** Early WIP (Sep 2025). Working libnx stub + Python packer pipeline + icon auto-fetch are in place.  
> `tools/hacbrewpack/` is vendored as a git submodule; NSP build/forwarder flow is the next milestone.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- **devkitPro + libnx** installed and on `PATH`.
- **Python 3.10+** for the packer.
- **Pillow** (installed via requirements.txt) for icon conversion/fallback generation.
- A working **Makefile** in `stub/` (provided) that accepts:
  - `APP_TITLE`, `APP_AUTHOR`, `APP_VERSION`, `ICON`
  - `ROMFS` folder contents (autopopulated by the packer)
  - **hacBrewPack** for NSP builds (already included as a submodule).

### Cloning with submodules

When cloning this repo, make sure to pull submodules so `tools/hacbrewpack/` is available:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/HarleyBartles/switch-rom-packer
```

If you already cloned without submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Build a batch of NROs

```bash
# Example:
python3 packer.py ~/rom_input/
```

**Notes:**

- `rom_root` is the **positional first argument** (e.g. `~/rom_input/`).
- `--build-nro` is **on by default**; you don‚Äôt need to pass it.
- `--stub-dir`, `--output-dir`, and `--filelist-out` all have sensible defaults.
- The packer writes a `filelist.txt` into the stub‚Äôs RomFS (platform + filename)
  which the stub reads to copy the ROM to `/roms/<platform>/<romfile>` at first launch.
- The icon pipeline:
  - Looks up `Named_Logos`, `Named_Boxarts`, `Named_Titles`, then `Named_Snaps` in that order (logos first).
  - Can be overridden with `--icon-preference boxarts`.

---

## How it works

1. **packer.py** discovers ROMs under `rom_root`, infers platform (simple rules for now), then:
   - Generates a per-ROM stub **RomFS** with a `filelist.txt`.
   - Calls the stub **Makefile** to produce a per-ROM **NRO** with dynamic title and icon.
   - Icons are auto-fetched from Libretro thumbnails, cached under `~/.switch-rom-packer/cache/icons/`.
   - Writes outputs to the chosen `--output-dir`.

2. **stub/** (libnx) boots, reads `filelist.txt`, and performs a one-time copy to the SD card.

3. **NSP build integration (in progress)**  
   - `tools/hacbrewpack/` is included as a submodule.  
   - Upcoming work: use it to produce **NSP forwarders** so installed titles show up on the HOME menu and launch directly into the game.

## Setup

It‚Äôs recommended to use a Python virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

```bash
# create a venv in the project root (only once)
python3 -m venv .venv

# activate it
# on Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# on Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# install dependencies into the venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage (packer.py)

```
usage: packer.py [-h] [--build-nro/--no-build-nro]
                 [--stub-dir STUB_DIR] [--output-dir OUTPUT_DIR]
                 [--filelist-out FILELIST_OUT]
                 [--icon-preference {logos, boxarts}]
                 [--debug-icons]
                 rom_root
```

- `rom_root` (positional): directory containing your ROMs.
- `--build-nro` (default **enabled**): produce NROs via the stub Makefile.
- `--no-build-nro`: use to disable NRO output.
- `--stub-dir`: path to the libnx stub (default: `./stub`).
- `--output-dir`: directory for generated NROs (sensible default).
- `--filelist-out`: where to write the stub‚Äôs `filelist.txt` (default aligns with stub layout).
- `--icon-preference` (options [`logos`, `boxarts`], default `logos`): choose thumbnail set priority.
- `--debug-icons`: enable additional logging during icon lookup.

---

## Development

- The Makefile is wired so the packer can set `APP_TITLE/APP_AUTHOR/APP_VERSION/ICON`
  and populate **RomFS** for each ROM build automatically.
- Icon cache is stored under `~/.switch-rom-packer/cache/icons/`.
- `tools/hacbrewpack/` is vendored as a submodule (pinned release).
- Tests and simple fixtures live under `test/`.

## Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Done / baseline

- **libnx stub** that reads `filelist.txt` and copies to `/roms/<platform>/<romfile>`.
- **Python packer** that:
  - Takes `rom_root` as positional arg.
  - Defaults `--build-nro` to **on**.
  - Provides sensible defaults for `--stub-dir`, `--output-dir`, `--filelist-out`.
  - Integrates with the Makefile (RomFS auto-population, dynamic titles, icons).
  - Fetches and caches Libretro thumbnails (logos/boxarts) with fallback initials icons.
  - **hacBrewPack vendored** as `tools/hacbrewpack/` submodule, ready for NSP build step.

### üöß In progress / next up

1. **NSP build integration**
   - Wire up **hacBrewPack** from the packer to emit per-ROM NSPs.
   - Create a **RetroArch forwarder NSP** flow: install a small forwarder that launches RetroArch and immediately boots the copied ROM with the correct core.

2. **Platform detection & metadata**
   - Expand platform inference rules (by folder name and filename suffixes).
   - Optional manifest file to pin platform/core when heuristics are ambiguous.

3. **RetroArch core mapping**
   - Maintain a simple map: `<platform> -> <core name>`.
   - Allow per-title overrides.

4. **Quality & DX**
   - Dry-run mode, better logging, progress bars for big batches.
   - Structured outputs + summary table at the end (counts, failures).
   - CI checks (format, lint, stub compiles).

### üìå Nice-to-haves

- Optional content-hash de-duplication (skip rebuild if ROM+settings unchanged).
- Simple HTML report of a batch (titles, platforms, icon hits/misses).
- Pluggable ‚Äúicon providers‚Äù (try multiple FOSS sources in order).

### ‚ùì Out of scope (for now)

- Live scraping of non-FOSS or rate-limited sources.
- Multi-ROM compilations in a single title (e.g., collections).

---

## Known limitations

- NSP forwarders aren‚Äôt implemented yet ‚Äî submodule is vendored, but integration logic still pending.
- Platform detection is heuristic and may need manual overrides for edge cases.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I just run `python3 packer.py ~/rom_input/` without extra flags?**  
Yes. That‚Äôs the intended default path: it builds NROs using sensible defaults.

**Q: Where do ROMs end up on the SD card?**  
On first run the stub copies them to `/roms/<platform>/<romfile>`.

**Q: Will these show up as installable titles on HOME?**  
Not yet. That‚Äôs what the NSP + forwarder pipeline will enable.
